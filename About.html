management software it is empowered to perform the basic operations of library :- Inserting Books, Inserting Borrowers,<br>
 Handling transactions etc but it is its other features which makes the software robust. Some of the features imbibed in this<br>
 software are :<br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	•	Ease of use.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	•	Ability to change themes,fonts,background colours etc.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	•	Ability to create database backups,load the same without bothering the user of any tedious backend handling.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	•	Enhanced security features like secure login etc.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	•	Lesser priveleges to the guest account.<br><br>
